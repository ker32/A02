So far, I have only been able to make an account on Github and not yet on Webstorm. 

Terms:
Branch - a separate version of your repository that allows you to make 'offline' changes from that you can publish when finished;
Clone - to make an additional copy of your repository that is stored on your computer;
Commit - a change made to a file that can be recorded to keep track of all changes made to that file;
Fetch - this sends main repository changes and updates to the local branch and does not commit them;
GIT - a useful program to keep a record of changes made in files;
Github - used for programmers to create files, code, record changes, and work on projects;
Merge - updates the changes made in one branch to another;
Merge Conflict - when two branches that merge have differences between the lines, or the wrong part is deleted;
Push - is used when sending saved changes and committed updates to a working repository;
Pull - is used when recieving updates and merging that data;
Remote - when a branch or repository is connected to a server;
Repository - a documented folder that records all updates, can have collaborators;
